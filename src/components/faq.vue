                    <strong class="text-lg font-semibold">What level of coding knowledge/language do you need to know in order to benefit from the course?</strong>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Having some programming experience is pretty important for getting value out of the second half of the bootcamp. The first two days involve zero coding and the third and fourth have more, but we intentionally put you on pairs/teams that are balanced so that even if someone doesn’t have as much programming skills they can still contribute and learn. Feel free to reach out (hello at trading dot camp) if you're unsure.</p>

                    <strong class="text-lg font-semibold">What level of math background is required?</strong>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">There’s basically no content prerequisites, in that the bootcamp won’t use calculus or linear algebra or anything. That being said, it's pretty helpful to be a person comfortable thinking in mathematical frameworks - in particular the concept of expected value/probability. A lot of trading is about fast heuristic reasoning instead of having precise or sophisticated mathematical models, but those heuristics are still shaped by mathematics intuitions. If you’re “not a math person” it’s likely going to be a bad fit, but if you’re “into math but haven’t taken high level classes yet” that’s 100% fine and common</p>

                    <strong class="text-lg font-semibold">Is housing provided?</strong>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">It’s not included in the cost, but we'll give you good options on-site at the venue or nearby (depending on the workshop you attend). People might also try to coordinate housing via the <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/qtb-discord" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Discord server</a>.</p>

                    <strong class="text-lg font-semibold">What are the demographics of attendees?</strong>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">A range: most are between jobs, a handful with experience in software engineering, some with experience in finance but not in trading specifically, some currently in college or recent graduates.</p>

                <li class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
                    <strong class="text-lg font-semibold">Can I volunteer in exchange for a discounted ticket?</strong>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">On rare occasions, we do occasionally price discriminate, but usually not for free. Depending on the camp, we might ask you to help out day-of, or recruit some number of full-paying participants, or providing a few hours of marketing consulting, or connecting us to a company that decides to <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/qtb-corporate-partnerships" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">sponsor us/have us run a private bootcamp</a>, etc.or some other thing that would be valuable to us.</p>

                    <strong class="text-lg font-semibold">Will this help me get a job?</strong>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Probably not. Our median value-add is giving participants a fluent intuition for market dynamics, not getting them a job. You'll probably meet some traders/finance folks, and we might have a few sponsors looking to hire, but we definitely do not optimize the camp around getting you hired. There's no certification, we're not prepping you for interviews, etc. The bootcamp could, however, be helpful for giving you a taste of what being a quant trader is like, so that you can make a more informed decision about whether it's a career you want to go into.</p>

                    <strong class="text-lg font-semibold">Is there any certification?</strong>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Nope. For what it’s worth, I think most firms view those things as bullshit anyway, and the ones that do care about it aren’t that good. The quality firms basically only care about raw intelligence and ability to solve problems on the fly.</p>

                    <strong class="text-lg font-semibold">Do you offer refunds?</strong>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">You can get refunded for half the amount you paid for the bootcamp per day that you didn’t attend. So, if you paid $1500 for a 5-day bootcamp and decided a week beforehand not to attend, we’ll reimburse you for $750. If you decide one day into it that you don’t want to attend the rest of it, we’ll reimburse you for $600.</p>
